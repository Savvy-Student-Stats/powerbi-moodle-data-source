# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog][Keep a Changelog] and this project (somewhat) adheres to [Semantic Versioning][Semantic Versioning].

The [changelog-generator vscode extension][changelog-generator]  was used to create this file.
Trying `ember` and other templates. Whatever suits my needs, tickles my fancy.The vscode extension may, or may-not, be used in future, but it is very neat.

### 2021-02-14 - v0.14 - Power BI Report Works with Courses, Grades, and Assignments!
Skipping 0.13 b/c lots of changes and 13 is said to be unlucky.

Got it working last night around 2 AM.
Pubished to Power BI Workspace.
Was so freaking excited!
Still am :)

It's everything I could have hoped for, and more!

Not sure about ths changelog title format, probably change in future Trying to fcus on actually finishing the Power BI report, rather than document everything. Hmm...
